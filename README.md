# WHAT IS IT?

**Are You A Potato Drawer** is a program/game that recognizes shpes drawn by the user by using computer vision techniques. For our application, we present the user with a canvas and ask them to draw a random shape (from our template image library). The user then draws on the provided canvas and pressed the “Enter” button when finished. After the user is done drawing, our program detects if the user drew the correct shape. 

Our application was inspired by the Google application, “Quick, Draw!”. Here is a link to the application: https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/
